# Circle Pattern Generator
Circle Pattern Generator is an interactive art tool for creating unique circular patterns.

## How To Use
Click through the canvas to cycle through randomly selected pattern & color elements. Use the R key to rotate the shape.

To aid your creation, you can turn on the Auto-Generator to let the machine co-create with you. It won't change the pattern you have created, but everything else is fair game.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
Q: Create a random pattern
R: Rotate a pattern block
