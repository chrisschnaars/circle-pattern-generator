# Circle Pattern Generator
Circle Pattern Generator is an interactive art tool for creating unique circular patterns.

## How To Use
Click through the canvas to cycle through randomly selected pattern & color elements. Use the R key to rotate the shape.

To aid your creation, you can turn on the Auto-Generator to let the machine co-create with you. It won't change the pattern you have created, but everything else is fair game.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
Q: Add a Bubble
P: Remove a Bubble
Spacebar: Play/Pause Bubble Tones

## Audio Interactions
The tones that play when Bubbles collide with the wall are selected from the root toneâ€™s major and minor scales. The selection of the scale and tone has some randomness built in, which is intended to create even more unexpected variety in each composition.
